A data generation pipeline for creating semi-realistic synthetic multi-object 
videos with rich annotations such as instance segmentation masks, depth maps, 
and optical flow.

## Motivation and design
We need better data for training and evaluating machine learning systems, especially in the context of unsupervised multi-object video understanding.
Current systems succeed on [toy datasets](https://github.com/deepmind/multi_object_datasets), but fail on real-world data.
Progress could be greatly accelerated if we had the ability to create suitable datasets of varying complexity on demand.
Kubric is mainly built on-top of pybullet (for physics simulation) and Blender (for rendering); however, the code is kept modular to potentially support different rendering backends.

## Getting started
For instructions, please refer to [https://kubric.readthedocs.io](https://kubric.readthedocs.io)

Assuming you have docker installed, to generate the data above simply execute:
```
git clone https://github.com/google-research/kubric.git
cd kubric
docker pull kubricdockerhub/kubruntu
docker run --rm --interactive \
           --user $(id -u):$(id -g) \
           --volume "$(pwd):/kubric" \
           kubricdockerhub/kubruntu \
           /usr/bin/python3 examples/helloworld.py
ls output
```

Kubric employs **Blender 2.93** (see [here](https://github.com/google-research/kubric/blob/01a08d274234f32f2adc4f7d5666b39490f953ad/docker/Blender.Dockerfile#L48)), so if you want to inspect the generated `*.blend` scene file for interactive inspection (i.e. without needing to render the scene), please make sure you have installed the correct Blender version. 

## Requirements
- A pipeline for conveniently generating video data. 
- Physics simulation for automatically generating physical interactions between multiple objects.
- Good control over the complexity of the generated data, so that we can evaluate individual aspects such as variability of objects and textures.
- Realism: Ideally, the ability to span the entire complexity range from CLEVR all the way to real-world video such as YouTube8. This is clearly not feasible, but we would like to get as close as possible. 
- Access to rich ground truth information about the objects in a scene for the purpose of evaluation (eg. object segmentations and properties)
- Control the train/test split to evaluate compositionality and systematic generalization (for example on held-out combinations of features or objects)


## Challenges and datasets
Generally, we store datasets for the challenges in this [Google Cloud Bucket](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/kubric-public).
More specifically, these challenges are *dataset contributions* of the Kubric CVPR'22 paper:
* [MOVi: Multi-Object Video](challenges/movi)
* [Texture-Structure in NeRF](challenges/texture_structure_nerf)
* [Optical Flow](challenges/optical_flow)
* [Pre-training Visual Representations](challenges/pretraining_visual)

* [Complex BRDFs](challenges/complex_brdf)
* [Single View Reconstruction](challenges/single_view_reconstruction)
* [Video Based Reconstruction](challenges/video_based_reconstruction)
* [Point Tracking](challenges/point_tracking)
