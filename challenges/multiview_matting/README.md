# Multi-view object matting

This dataset creates a scene where a foreground object is to be distinguished
from the background. Foreground objects are borrowed from shapnet. Backgrounds
are from indoor scenes of polyhaven. All foreground objects are situated on top
of a "table" which is gernated to be random in color. Instead of background
removal with a single image. This dataset is special in that multiple images of
the foreground object (taken from different camera poses) are given. This
"multi-view" persepctive should be very helpful for background removal but is
currently underexplored in the literature.

The dataset is divided into two difficulties levels: *easy* and *hard*.
For the easy challenge, scenes only contain one salient object within the scene,
while in the hard challenge we additionally insert clutter.
See example training images as well as ground truth masks
from *easy* and *hard*:
